ðŸ”® Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visual learning tool that brings sorting algorithms to life. Instead of just reading code, you can see how algorithms work step by step with smooth animations and interactive controls.

ðŸŒŸ Highlights

ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful UI with colorful bars and animations

âš¡ Real-time Sorting with speed control

ðŸ“Š Supports popular algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick

ðŸ“± Responsive Design â€“ works across devices

ðŸ”— Python + JavaScript Integration â€“ backend logic powered by Flask, visual layer handled in JS

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone the repo

Install Flask:

pip install flask


Run the app:

python app.py


Open in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

Sorting algorithms are a core part of computer science, but they can feel abstract when studied in theory.
This project turns them into a visual, interactive experience so learners can:

Understand the process behind each algorithm

Compare how fast or slow each one works

Build intuition for algorithmic thinking
